## Introduction

The phenotype is a term used in genetics to define the set of observable traits in an organism. It can be seen as the result of three factors: the expression of the genetic code of an organism, its interaction with the environment, and some casual events which can occur during its life. In particular, the main aspect is the gene expression, which is the process by which the information from a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene product, like RNA or proteins, essential for the life of all organisms and many viruses. The first step to define the gene expression is to study the DNA, which is the essential molecule that characterizes the organisms in general. It contains all the genetic instructions which regulate this process. Starting from its structure, the DNA is composed of two chains of nucleotides, combined together composing a double helix. This molecule can be divided into subsequences of nucleotides and each of them has a specific task. These sequences can be grouped into two sets according to their main purpose: the coding and non-coding region. The coding regions contain the code to synthesize some gene products (the gene) and the non-coding regions (also known as cis-regulatory elements, CREs) are responsible to help, regulate or modify the creation process of a gene product. The gene expression involves both these regions of the DNA and it is composed of two main processes: transcription and translation. Through the transcription process, a particular DNA coding region is copied inside the messenger RNA (mRNA) thanks to some proteins, the RNA polymerase, and other transcription factors, specific for the gene product. In particular, RNA polymerase binds to a particular region of DNA, called the promoter, and activates the transcription process. The initial version of mRNA contains redundant information and it consists of alternating segments called exons (coding regions) and introns (redundant regions). The RNA splicing method is applied in order to remove the introns and to produce the final mRNA sequence. After that, the mRNA goes out from the cell nucleus, and then the translation process starts. The mRNA sequence is divided into small groups of 3 nucleotides, called codon. Each of these triplets corresponds to a specific amino acid. The result sequence of amino acids forms the final gene product. It is important to specify that a single coding region can encode various product and the non-coding region play a big role in the gene expression. There are two main types of non-coding regions: trans-regulatory elements (TREs) and cis-regulatory elements (CREs). TREs are particular types of genes that may modify or regulate the expression of other genes, often encoding transcription factors. Other non-coding regions, the CREs, are close to the genes that they regulate by bindings to the transcription factor. In particular, enhancers and silencers interact with promoters, through RNA polymerase and other transcription factors, respectively to influence or repress the gene expression.
